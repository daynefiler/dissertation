This work would not have been possible without the support of my PhD mentor, Kirk Wilhelmsen.
Kirk provided mentorship, advice, and care in and out of the laboratory.
Most importantly, Kirk encouraged me to pursue research and avenues to best serve my career -- even when my path did not further his own research program.

My scientific training began with Sara Heggland at the College of Idaho.
I spent four years working under Sara's mentorship; she, more than anyone, taught me the scientific method and galvanized my path to research.
I am forever grateful she took me under her wing.
After graduating from college, David Reif, Richard Judson, Matthew Martin, and others at the National Center for Computational Toxicology allowed me to find my passion for data science.
Working at NCCT gave me the practical skills to thrive in a data science PhD.

Thank you to Stan Ahalt and all of the people at the Renaissance Computing Institute for welcoming and supporting me, particularly Chris Bizon and Phil Owen.
Thank you to my committee, Bradford Powell, Stan Ahalt, Neeta Vora, and Yun Li. 
In addition, I want to thank all of my collaborators for this work, especially: Jonathan Berg, Alicia Brandt, Piotr Mieczkowski, Karen Dorman, Amber Ivins, and Fengshen Kuo. 

Thank you to the UNC MD-PhD program for accepting and supporting me both through medical school and my PhD training. 

Finally, thank you to my family and friends whose support outside of training have enabled and enriched my life and success.
